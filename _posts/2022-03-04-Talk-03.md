### Abstract:

Let R_1,R_2 be the Riesz transforms on the complex plane. The singular integral R=R_2+iR_1 is called the complex Riesz transform. We establish the estimates on $$L^p$$, $$1 < p < \infty$$  for the integer powers $$R^k$$ of $$R$$ that are sharp simultaneously in $$k$$ and $$p$$. This answers a question suggested in a 1996 work by Iwaniec and Martin. We present three different proofs of this result. We also conjecture the exact values of the $$L^p$$ norms of $$R^k$$. This is a joint work with Andrea Carbonaro and Vjekoslav Kovac.

### Abstract:
Legendrian links are central objects of study in the intersection of
low-dimensional topology and contact geometry. For Legendrian links in the
3-sphere, Ozsvath, Szabo, and Thurston defined combinatorial invariants that
reside in grid homology, a combinatorial version of knot Floer homology. Known
as the GRID invariants, they are effective in distinguishing some Legendrian
knots that have the same classical invariants. In this talk, we describe how
the GRID invariants also obstruct decomposable Lagrangian cobordisms, a result
joint with John Baldwin and Tye Lidman. If time permits, we will also outline
constructing decomposable Lagrangian cobordisms from any pair of Legendrian
links to a common target Legendrian link, a result joint with Josh Sabloff and
Shea Vela-Vick. No background in contact geometry or Floer homology will be
assumed, and the talk will be self-contained.

### Abstract:

The investigation of strongly minimal surfaces was initiated by Bang-Yen Chen in 2001, in the context of investigating geometric inequalities in Kaehlerian context. In our work, an inequality characterized strongly minimal co-isotropic light-like submanifolds is given. Strongly minimal Monge-type light-like hypersurfaces in $$C_{1}^{4}$$ are examined.

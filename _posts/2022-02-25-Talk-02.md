### Abstract:

We present a method of describing all timelike surfaces in $$\mathbb S^3_1(1)$$ using null coordinates and complex variable.  We use stereographic projection to identify necessary and sufficient conditions for lifting our timelike surfaces in $$\mathbb S^3_1(1)$$ into a special complex quadric of the complex projective space and then we study that surfaces. In particular we introduce a new class of complex functions, called quasi-holomorphic, that contains the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic functions. Next, we obtain a remarkable correspondence between timelike minimal surfaces in $$\mathbb S^3_1(1)$$ and pairs of quasi-holomorphic functions.

This work is joint with Prof. A.P. Franco-Filho (IME-USP) and M. Magid (Wellesley College).

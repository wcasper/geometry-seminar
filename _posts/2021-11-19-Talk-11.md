### Abstract:

Cluster Algebras were defined by Fomin and Zelevinsky twenty years
ago, and since then have played a key role in many areas of
mathematics and mathematical physics. We will present a gentle
introduction to the subject and describe a framework for root of unity
quantum cluster algebras, which gives a uniform approach to various
important families of algebras from Lie theory and topology. We will
show that they have canonical trace maps turning them into
Cayley-Hamilton algebras. Such algebras have discriminants given by a
generalization of Dedekind's construction for number fields. An
effective way for computing these discriminants will be presented.
This is a joint work with Shengnan Huang, Thang Le, Bach Nguyen and
Kurt Trampel.

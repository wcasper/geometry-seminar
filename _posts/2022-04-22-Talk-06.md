### Abstract:

We show that Lorentz-Finsler geometry offers a powerful tool in obtaining inequalities.
With this aim, we first point out that a series of famous inequalities such as: the (weighted)
arithmetic-geometric mean inequality, Aczel's, Popoviciu's and Bellman's inequalities, are all
particular cases of a reverse Cauchy-Schwarz, respectively, of a reverse triangle inequality holding
in Lorentz-Finsler geometry. Then, we use the same method to prove some completely new
inequalities, including two refinements of Aczel's inequality.

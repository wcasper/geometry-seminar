The CSUF Virtual Geometry Seminar is an extension of the Geometry Seminar first established at CSUF in 2007.  It is intended as a venue for talks related to geometry and topology (broadly interpreted) and to be a place where faculty from many different universities can find a friendly and collaborative atmosphere.
